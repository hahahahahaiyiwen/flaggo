# Data Plane

The data-plane host evaluates exact registered decision identities and confirms
exposures.

It composes registry reads, evidence, governed state, policy, reasoning, and
audit ports. Contract/configuration errors fail closed; only explicitly
eligible availability failures may reach an SDK-local fallback. Keep its wire
behavior aligned with `contracts/openapi/flaggo-runtime-v1.yaml`.
